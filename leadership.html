        <h1>Sprint Long Leadership Roles</h1>
        <p>These four roles are changed at the beginning of every sprint, and last for the duration of each sprint. During the season everyone has a chance to be at least one of these leadership roles. </p>

        <h2>Sprint Pilot</h2>
        <p>The Sprint Pilot guides the team through our daily stand-up meetings. 
            
            In our stand-up meetings we ask:
            <ol>
                <li>What have I completed since we last met that contributes to our Sprint goal?</li>
                <li>What do I plan to complete next that contributes to our Sprint goal?</li>
                <li>Do I have any blockers or impediments? Does the team?</li></ol>

             If there are any blockers or impediments the Sprint Pilotâ€™s job is to help solve these or plan possible solutions to help the team move forward.</p>
                   
            



        </p>


        <h2>Team Reps</h2>
        <p>The Team Reps help make sure our progress is steady and we are doing the right things.

            <ul>Team Reps will also help: 
                    <li>Come up with ideas for the season backlog</li>
                    <li>Leads choosing what goes into our sprint log</li>
                    <li>Helps to decide if a task is done or not</li>
                    <li>Help prioritize our season and sprint logs and the order of the tasks in them</li>
                    <li>Makes sure tasks are broken up, small, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">S.M.A.R.T.</a>, and manageable</li>
                    <li>Checks to make sure we are getting what we need done and nothing is missing</li>
                    <li>Adds fun</li>
                    <li>Talks to their teammates to make sure things are going smoothly</li>
                    
            </ul>
